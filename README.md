# Cookie Clicker

## Phase 0:

I want to make a **Cookie Clicker** game. This game
involves clicking on a picture of a cookie to 
acquire more cookies. You can then use the cookies
to purchase cookie makers that will automatically
generate cookies in the background. This application
can be used by anyone who wants to have fun playing
a simple and relaxing game. I chose to pursue this 
project because Cookie Clicker is one of my favourite 
casual games and I think it is an achievable game to
program using the things that I will learn in this course.

*User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to see a counter
that keeps track of how many cookies I have.
- As a user, I want to be able to add an arbitrary
  amount of "cookie makers" that generate cookies in
  the background.
- As a user, I want to see how many cookies are 
being automatically generated by the "cookie makers" per
second.
- As a user, I want to be able to have a model of 
a cookie that, when clicked, would increase my cookie
count.

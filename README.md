# Cookie Clicker

## Phase 0/1:

I want to make a **Cookie Clicker** game. This game
involves clicking on a picture of a cookie to 
acquire more cookies. I want the user
to be able to set goals for how many cookies they want to
acquire. This application can be used by anyone who wants 
to have fun playing a simple and relaxing game. I chose to 
pursue this project because Cookie Clicker is one of my favourite 
casual games and I think it is an achievable game to
program using the things that I will learn in this course.

*User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to increase the amount of
cookies I have by pressing a certain key on the 
keyboard. (This will later change when gui is implemneted
later on)
- As a user, I want to be able to see a counter
that keeps track of how many cookies I have.
- As a user, I want to be able to add an arbitrary
amount of milestones for myself. The milestones will be in the form of reaching a certain
amount of cookies. 
- As a user, I want to be able to check if the milestones
I have set have been reached.

## Phase 2:
*User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of the game to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to reload the saved state and resume playing
the game where it left off.

## Phase 3:
### Instructions for Grader:

- You can generate the first required event by
clicking on the "set milestone" button. You will then
be prompted to input an integer to set a new milestone.
- You can generate the second required event by clicking
on the "view milestones" button. A new window will appear
that displays all the milestones that have been set so far and
update their statuses accordingly.
- You can locate my visual component by noticing the 
counter at the top left of the screen that keeps track
of how many cookies have been acquired. Click the big brown 
button underneath the counter to see it change.
- You can save the state of my application by closing the main
window. A new window will appear that give the user the option
of saving the game.
- You can reload the state of my application when it is first run. 
A small window will appear that gives the user the option of loading
the game state from the saved file.

## Phase 4:

### Task 2:
Here is what should print out in the console 
after clicking the "view milestones" button twice
and then setting a new milestone:   
Event log cleared.    
Milestones were updated and viewed   
Milestones were updated and viewed   
A new milestone was set
